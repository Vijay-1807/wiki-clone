# C
## 🌐 C Programming Language

**C** is a general-purpose, structured programming language known for its **popularity**, **simplicity**, and **flexibility**. It is **machine-independent**, meaning programs written in C can run on different hardware with minimal changes.

Due to its **efficiency** and fine control over **system resources**, C is widely used in the development of:

- 🖥️ **Operating Systems** (e.g., *Windows*)
- 🗄️ **Databases** (e.g., *Oracle*)
- 🛠️ **Development Tools** (e.g., *Git*)
- 🧠 **Language Interpreters** (e.g., *Python*)
- ⚙️ **Other Complex Software Systems**

Its combination of **low-level access** and **high-level structure** makes C ideal for **system-level programming** and **performance-critical applications**.
